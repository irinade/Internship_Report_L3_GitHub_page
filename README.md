# Internship_Report_L3_"Understand the mechanisms by which birds are producing vocalizations"_GitHub_page

You will be able to find here my internship report and the pdf of the presentation I gave afterward.

You will also find a part of my work on the gathering and analysis of bird recordings. You will find programs and videos.

Only a part of my work is present as the global Birdsong GitHub is private for know and I am not allowed to share all my work publicaly.
However it is enough to test and run the code and look at the program I wrote.

I arranged my folder on the R Notebook following input (things needed to run the code, here raw data), program (everything you need to launch manually), output (things that are generated by the program) interface in order to make it easily comprehensible for everyone. As I worked on two project (extraction of acoustic parameters and analysis of acoustic parameters) you will find in folder separately the work for these two projects.

You can also have access to the weekly blog I kept during the internsip here : https://projects.cri-paris.org/projects/vXCBp29N/summary
